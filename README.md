# Todo_python_project

This is a flask resources project

We use the basic stuff in python conditionals, variables, functions & classes
In flask we use the modules request, redirect, render  & request
To communicate our html with python we use the powerfull jinja2
And for storage in data base we use sqlalchemy

The css is quite basic and simple and needs to be improved
